    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      This is one of my grandmother's recipes, a Southern classic. It is similar
      to a doberge--six thin layers with a tart lemon filling. I usually need 3
      large fresh lemons for this recipe to produce the zest and juice.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>6 eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon grated lemon peel</li>
      <li>1 ¾ teaspoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated lemon peel</li>
      <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
      <li>5 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 3
          9-inch cake pans. In a bowl, whisk together 3 1/4 cups of flour,
          baking powder, and salt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cream 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons softened butter in a large bowl with an
          electric mixer until smooth, then mix in 2 1/4 cups of sugar until
          thoroughly blended and fluffy. Beat 6 egg yolks into the butter
          mixture, one at a time, beating well after each yolk is added. Beat
          the flour mixture into the butter mixture in thirds, alternating with
          milk. Mix in 3/4 teaspoon of grated lemon peel and 1 3/4 teaspoon of
          lemon juice.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          With clean beaters, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks in a bowl;
          lightly fold the egg whites into the batter; use a rubber spatula or
          wire whisk to fold 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the batter.
          Gently run the spatula through the center of the bowl, then around the
          sides of the bowl, repeating until fully incorporated. Add the
          remaining egg whites, folding just until incorporated.. Pour the
          batter into the 3 prepared cake pans.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
          of a cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow cakes to cool in
          pans for 10 minutes; then turn out onto a rack to finish cooling.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To make filling, whisk 2 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons of grated lemon
          peel, 1/2 cup of lemon juice, 5 1/2 tablespoons of flour, and beaten
          egg together in a saucepan. Cook the mixture over low heat, whisking
          constantly, until the filling almost comes to a boil; cook until
          thickened and smooth, about 1 minute. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of butter
          until melted. Allow the filling to cool.
        </p>
      </li>

          To assemble, place each cake layer down on a work surface, and place
          one hand lightly on the top of the cake. Use a serrated knife to slice
          the cake in half horizontally, with a light sawing motion, to create 2
          layers from each cake (6 total layers). Brush crumbs from the layers.
          Place a cake layer onto a serving dish, and spread with 1/6 of the
          filling; repeat with all the layers and filling, ending with a layer
          of lemon filling for the top of the cake.
